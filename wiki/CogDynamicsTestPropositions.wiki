Do physical movements reveal anything about higher level cognitive dynamics?  Traditional AI systems which follow the sense-interpret-plan-act pipeline assume that there are separate modules with discreet interfaces between them, such that the internal workings of one module has little to do with the internal workings of the preceding one.  However, although this approach may be convenient from a software engineering perspective it isn't really how brains work.  The brain is instead a large parallel system where multiple systems may be operating and interacting simultaneously, with the evolutionary imperitive to make a decision as soon as possible (before you get eaten).

The idea of parallism, accompanied by some winner-takes-all competitive suppression when making a decision is not new.  However, the suppression between competing decision makers or behaviors may not be perfect, with some of the losers still having an lesser effect upon the overall outcome.

When making a yes or no response to a proposition is your level of confidence apparent within the physical movements made when dragging a mouse over an icon?  This test is intended to demonstrate that it is.
