#summary What is GAC-80K

GAC-80K is a set of 80,000 propositions in plain english stored within a text file.  It was originally released in 2005 as a subset of the mindpixel data gathered betwenen 2000-2005.

The terms of use for GAC-80K specify that the data is only to be used for research or non-commercial uses, but since the original mindpixel project no longer exists this probably doesn't apply to contemporary users, unless some new ownership claim is forthcoming.

It is assumed that the original mindpixel database was lost or destroyed, after the death of its curator in 2006, but most of this data will have been of low quality or have consisted of unvalidated singular votes within the "long tail".
