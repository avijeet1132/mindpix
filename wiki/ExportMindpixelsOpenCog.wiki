#summary How to export mindpixels to OpenCog

OpenCog currently uses the Scheme language as the recommended way of entering data into the system.  To create a Scheme formatted text file suitable for this purpose the *mpexport* utility can be used.

{{{
    mpexport.exe -mindpixels /usr/bin/mindpixels.txt -oc scheme.txt
}}}

This reads in the mindpixels contained within a text file, such as GAC-80K, parses them, then saves them as predicates to a file called scheme.txt in a format which OpenCog can recognise.
