#summary mpgac: A minimally intelligent AGI
#labels AGI,intelligentsignal

When scanning the skies how can we tell whether the radio signals detected are from an intelligent source, or are merely just background or sensor noise?

mpgac is a program created from the GAC-80K corpus capable of answering yes or no questions.  An _unintelligent system_ within this class would only be able to answer yes or no randomly, or perhaps with some small bias towards a yes answer.  A system with minimal human-like intelligence sound be able to provide answers with a statistical profile measurably higher than chance would predict.

mpgac is a stand alone program, and doesn't require either the original text corpus or a database.  Instead it uses an image where each point represents a proposition plotted in a phonetic coordinate space.  The image could be regarded as a kind of compression of the original corpus - with the boolean nature of the propositions facilitating maximum compressibility.

To install mpgac:

{{{
    sudo dpkg -i mpgac.deb
}}}

Use of the program is extremely simple.

{{{
    mpgac.exe Do chairs have legs?
}}}
